#Microwave Oven

A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Input Format:

The first input is an integer which corresponds to the number of items. The second integer is a float which corresponds to the single item heating time.

Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

Note:All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output

Sample Input and Output 1:

Enter the number of items

2

Enter the single item heating time

5.0

The recommended heating time is 7.50

 Sample Input and Output 2:

Enter the number of items

4

Enter the single item heating time

5.0

Number of items is more

solution:
x=int(input("Enter the number of items\n"))
y=float(input("Enter the single item heating time \n"))
if x==2:
    n=(50*y/100)+y
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"% n)
elif x==3:
    n=2*Y
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"% n)
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
